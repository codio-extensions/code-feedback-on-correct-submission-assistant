# custom-assistant-code-feedback-on-correct-submissions

This assistant example is designed to provide qualitative feedback on correct student submissions.

The idea is to provide more personalized feedback on student submissions, especially when its correct and there are ways to make the code:
1. Less complex
2. More efficient
3. Adhere to best practices (code style, code readability, etc.)

Tweak the `systemPrompt` or `userPrompt` to change/edit/update the guidelines or if you'd prefer a certain style of feedback. 
for eg. with or without code snippets, more or less verbose, etc.
